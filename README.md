# Ham-Radio-RSS-Feeds

This repository contains an OPML file containing Ham Radio related RSS feeds.

At the moment there are two categories:

 * Fediverse Hams: Web sites of ham radio operators that are active in the Fediverse
 * Ham Radio: Everything else (news sites, personal blogs etc.)

Please help me with this with additions and corrections by sending PRs, opening issues or contacting me directly: https://dk1mi.radio/about/
